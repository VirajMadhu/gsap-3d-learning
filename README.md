# GSAP Animations Showcase

A showcase of interactive 2D and 3D animations created using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**. This repository is a learning project that demonstrates various animation techniques for modern web interactions, focusing on smooth, performant 2D and 3D animations.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **2D Animations**: Includes animated elements such as fades, slides, scaling, rotation, and parallax effects.
- **Interactive Demos**: Examples of hover, scroll-triggered, and timeline-based animations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging GSAP's efficiency for smooth and high-performance animations across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized components and reusable animation functions for easy customization.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `2D_Animations/`: A collection of 2D animation examples, including button effects, scroll animations, and interactive overlays.
- `Interactive_Demos/`: Live demos of interactive animations triggered by scroll, click, and hover events.

## ðŸ’» Technologies

- **GSAP**: For powerful animation controls and timeline management.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Structure and basic styling for animations.
- **ReactJs**: Core scripting to add logic and interactivity.

## ðŸ“ˆ Learning Goals

- Master GSAP's animation functions for both 2D and 3D spaces.
- Experiment with timelines, easing functions, and scroll triggers.
- Understand performance considerations for animations on the web.
